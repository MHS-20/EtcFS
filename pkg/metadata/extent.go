// Extent maps a logical byte range of an inode onto a range of the shared
// block device.
//
// Extents live under one key per extent, `extent:<ino>/<chunk>`, with the
// value encoded as
// `<logical_off>,<disk_off>,<length>,<generation>,<sequence>,<node>`.  The
// generation is the writer's fencing generation at commit time and node is the
// writer itself; the scrubber needs both, since a generation is per-node and
// means nothing without knowing whose it is.
//
// This file is the single owner of that encoding.  Nothing outside it should
// format or parse an extent key or value by hand.

	// splitting an extent has to produce two records that are both *as old as
