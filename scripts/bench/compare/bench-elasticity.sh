# bench-elasticity.sh — what a membership change costs the nodes that are
# already running. One node leaves the filesystem cleanly and later rejoins it,
# while every other node is writing the whole time, and the numbers are taken on
# those *other* nodes: how long their I/O stalled, and how much bandwidth they
# lost across the event.
#
# This is the "stop the world" question, made measurable. GFS2 (and OCFS2)
# suspend the DLM lockspace on every membership change: each surviving node
# stops granting locks until the new membership is agreed, so a node arriving or
# departing is felt by everyone. etcfs has no lockspace to suspend — membership
# is an etcd key, a node claims its own arena, and a clean leave hands back its
# locks in the same transaction that removes it — so the expected cost to the
# survivors is nothing. The three server-mediated or replicated backends are run
# for the same event because a client mount is genuinely cheap for them, which
# is worth showing rather than assuming.
#
# What "leave" and "join" mean per backend is compare_leave_fs/compare_join_fs
# (compare-backends.sh); the header there lists them. Nothing here is a kill —
# a crash is bench-node-kill.sh's scenario, and mixing the two would measure
# fencing rather than elasticity.
#
# The probe file is one the leaver itself was writing right up to its departure,
# so its locks on that inode really do have to move; a probe on an untouched
# file would let a backend look elastic by never having to transfer anything.
#
# ETCFS_ELASTIC_RUNTIME (default 30) is the seconds of load per phase.
# ETCFS_ELASTIC_WAIT (default 60) is how long the probe keeps running after the
# event, and therefore the largest stall this can report.
#
