# compare-backends.sh — "bring backend $COMPARE_BACKEND up on the cluster
# compare_provision just created, and hand back a path".
#
# The IOPS suite has one script per backend, each of which sets its backend up
# and immediately benchmarks it. The scenario suite inverts that: one script
# per *scenario*, run against whichever backend COMPARE_BACKEND names, so the
# setup half has to be callable on its own. It lives here rather than in
# compare-lib.sh only for size — compare-lib.sh sources this at the end, so
# every caller already has it.
#
# compare_mount sets, for the caller:
#   MOUNT_PATH   path of the filesystem under test, identical on every node
#                that has it
#   BENCH_NODES  public IPs that have it mounted, in cluster order
#   N0           BENCH_NODES[0] (bench-lib.sh's run_fio drives this one)
#
# Every backend's own quirks — which AMI, which ports, why gluster gets local
# volumes and juicefs does not — are documented in the matching bench-*.sh
# header, which is where the reasoning was worked out.

# compare_mount [mount_all]
# mount_all=1 (default) mounts on every node; the IOPS runs only ever needed

# node-kill run measures recovery rather than a lockspace that stopped for good.
#
# The difference from the bare stack is the whole point of the variant. There,
# corosync and dlm are started by hand and nothing is configured to fence, so
# when a node dies DLM moves its lockspace to "wait fencing" and stays there:
# survivors keep the locks they already hold and can never take the dead node's.
# Here pacemaker owns DLM and the mount as cloned resources, and a fence_aws
# STONITH device stops the dead instance through the EC2 API. DLM releases the
# lockspace only once pacemaker reports that stop confirmed, which is the
# sequence GFS2 was designed around and the one EtcFS's 2.19 s should be read
# against.
#
# Needs the STONITH policy from scripts/infra/fencing-iam.sh on the instance
# role (ec2:StopInstances on this harness's own instances) and fence_aws, which

# ---- node failure ----
#
# compare_kill_node <pub_ip> — take that node out the way a real failure would.
#
# The three shared-device backends are killed identically, and that is the whole
# point: the machine is powered off through sysrq, so nothing runs an exit path,
# nothing unmounts, nothing releases a lock, and no daemon gets to notice it is
# dying. Killing hand-picked daemons instead measured a different failure per
# backend — `killall -9 corosync dlm_controld` in particular is an orderly
# membership change, which is most of what "fence plus journal replay" was
# supposed to cost, so gfs2 was being asked to recover from something far milder
# than etcfs was. A comparison is only worth publishing if the fault is the same.
#
# The two server-mediated backends are killed exactly the same way, and for the
# same reason. They have no partial failure to inject — the server IS the
# filesystem — so the equivalent fault is losing the machine that runs it, which
# is what the other three lose too. An earlier version blocked their ports and
# killed their service processes instead, to make the outage begin at a known
# instant; measurement showed that fault did not reliably land at all (`iptables
# -I INPUT --dport 2049` left the NFS server answering on 2049 for the whole of
# a 180 s run, and `systemctl kill nfs-server` does not stop the kernel's nfsd
# threads), so the backend was being credited with surviving a failure it never
# had. The known instant now comes from the death watch
# (compare_death_watch_start), not from the shape of the fault, which frees the
# fault to be the same one everywhere.
#
# Powering the victim off is deliberately not undone: the survivor is what is
# being measured, and a victim that reboots and rejoins mid-run changes what the
# survivor is recovering from. Teardown destroys the cluster regardless.
